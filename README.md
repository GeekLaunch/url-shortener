A simple project to shorten URL's quickly and painlessly. Written using [Koa](http://koajs.com/) and [Knex.js](http://knexjs.org/).

Files not covered in the video:
* `apache.conf` contains the configuration I used to make `localhost:8088/api` go to `localhost:8989`
* `database.sql` contains the SQL code to create the database so you don't have to just type it all out
